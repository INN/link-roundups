## Overview

The Link Roundup plugin allows you to:

- Curate links
- Create link roundup posts
- Optionally send the roundup posts to MailChimp to be distributed to your subscribers

It also includes two widgets:

- A widget to display your recently saved links
- A widget to display your recent link roundup posts (with the ability to limit by category)

The plugin includes a browser bookmark that you can drag to your browser's bookmark bar, allowing you to save links directly to your WordPress site. This bookmark attempts to pre-fill fields like link title, source, URL and featured image and also allows you to add a description to each link viewable when published on your site.

In its previous life, Link Roundups was called Argo Links.

## Features

#### Saved Links
![New Saved Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INN/link-roundups/master/docs/img/new-saved-link-npr.png)

Curate links from around the web and save them in WordPress using a handy browser bookmark. You can also add your own descriptions and organize saved links using tags.

#### Saved Links Widget

Display a feed of your recent Saved Links, optionally filtered by tags.

#### Link Roundups
![Recent Saved Links Panel in Link Roundups Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INN/link-roundups/master/docs/img/link-roundups-passthru.png)

Build Link Roundup posts using a panel that displays and filters your recent Saved Links. Select the links you want to include and send them to the editor to compose your roundup posts.

#### Link Roundups Widget

Display most recent Link Roundup posts by date. Optionally, limit the roundup posts displayed by category.

#### MailChimp API Integration

Simplify your workflow by sending Link Roundup posts directly to MailChimp. Create a template for your roundups using a number of special template tags and then create a new MailChimp campaign directly from WordPress. You can even include sponsored links.

#### Rename Link Roundups

If you would prefer to call your roundup posts something else (daily digest, for example) you can rename the singular (default: Link Roundup) and plural form (default: Link Roundups) as well as the slug for posts in the Link Roundups custom post type. 

#### Custom HTML for Displaying Links

Link Roundup posts have some default styling for your saved links to make sure your posts look great out of the box. If you'd prefer to modify the HTML output for Save Links or styling for sponsored links, you can do that from the plugin settings.
