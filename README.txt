Curate links from around the web, create roundup posts -- optionally sent as email newsletters with MailChimp -- and use widgets to publish feeds.

== Description ==
Link Roundups enables you to:
* Curate links
* Create link roundup posts
* Optionally send the roundup posts to MailChimp to be distributed to your subscribers

It also includes two widgets:
* A widget to display your recently saved links
* A widget to display your recent link roundup posts (with the ability to limit by category)

The plugin includes a browser bookmark that you can drag to your browser\'s bookmark bar, allowing you to save links directly to your WordPress site. This bookmark attempts to pre-fill fields like link title, source, URL and featured image and also allows you to add a description to each link viewable when published on your site.

In its\' previous life, Link Roundups was called Argo Links.
